## üö® Project Overview

ResQ is a robust, full-stack mobile safety application meticulously designed to provide immediate assistance to women during emergencies. Leveraging the power of modern mobile technology, ResQ empowers users with a discreet and effective tool for personal safety. With a single **Panic Button** tap, the app instantly dispatches an SMS containing the user's **live location** to pre-registered **emergency contacts**, ensuring help is always just a second away.

## üß† Motto

> *Empowering safety with one tap. Help is just a second away.*

ResQ aims to provide quick, reliable, and discreet emergency assistance. It allows users to save trusted contacts, manage their emergency details, and instantly trigger alerts with real-time location.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **One-Tap Panic Button:** Instantly trigger an emergency alert.
*   **Live Location Sharing:** Sends real-time GPS coordinates via SMS to emergency contacts.
*   **Emergency Contact Management:** Add, edit, and prioritize trusted contacts.
*   **Secure User Authentication:** Implements JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user registration and login.
*   **Personal Profile Management:** Users can store critical medical information, allergies, blood group, and other vital details for first responders.
*   **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean, user-friendly design built with React Native.
*   **Backend Integration:** Seamless communication with a dedicated backend for data persistence and real-time updates.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

ResQ operates on a simple yet effective mechanism to ensure rapid response:

1.  **User Registration/Login:** Users securely register or log in to the application using JWT authentication, ensuring personalized and secure access.
2.  **Emergency Contact Setup:** Users can easily add, edit, and designate primary emergency contacts within their profile settings.
3.  **Panic Button Activation:** Upon pressing the "Panic Button":
    *   A subtle ripple animation provides immediate visual feedback to the user.
    *   The app retrieves the user's current live GPS location.
    *   An SMS containing the live location link (e.g., Google Maps link) is sent to all pre-registered emergency contacts.
    *   The user's last known location and emergency status are updated in the backend database.
4.  **Profile Management:** Users can update their personal and medical information, which can be crucial for emergency services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

ResQ is built using a modern, robust technology stack, primarily focused on JavaScript for both frontend and backend development.

### Frontend (Mobile App)

*   **React Native:** A JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps.
*   **Expo:** A framework and platform for universal React applications, simplifying development and deployment.
*   **React Navigation:** For handling navigation and routing within the app.
*   **`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`:** Persistent key-value storage for React Native.
*   **`axios`:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
*   **`@expo/vector-icons`:** Pre-made icons for a richer UI.
*   **`@react-native-picker/picker`:** Native select/picker component.

### Backend (API Server)

*(Assumed based on project structure and dependencies, typically Node.js with Express)*

*   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
*   **MongoDB (or similar NoSQL DB):** For storing user data, emergency contacts, location history, and profile information.
*   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure authentication and authorization.
*   **Twilio (or similar SMS Gateway API):** For sending SMS messages with live location. *(This would be an external dependency for the backend)*

## üöÄ Installation

To get ResQ up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/): `npm install -g expo-cli`

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kankaa16/ResQ.git
cd ResQ
```

### 2. Frontend Installation (Mobile App)

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Backend Installation & Setup (Assumed structure)

The `backend` folder suggests a separate server. You'll need to set up the backend server to handle user authentication, contact management, and location updates.

1.  Navigate into the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on a `.env.example` (if provided, otherwise create one) and configure necessary environment variables such as:
    *   `PORT=5000` (or your desired port)
    *   `MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/resq_db` (your MongoDB connection string)
    *   `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key`

4.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 4. Run the Mobile App

From the root directory of the repository (where `package.json` for the frontend is located):

```bash
expo start
```

This will open a new tab in your browser with Expo Dev Tools. You can then:
*   Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone.
*   Run on an Android emulator (`a` key in terminal).
*   Run on an iOS simulator (`i` key in terminal - macOS only).

---

## üí° Usage

Once the app is running and the backend server is active:

1.  **Register/Login:** Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2.  **Add Emergency Contacts:** Navigate to the contacts section and add phone numbers of your trusted contacts.
3.  **Update Profile:** Fill in your personal and medical information in the profile section.
4.  **Test the Panic Button:** In a safe environment, tap the "Panic Button" to simulate an emergency. Verify that your emergency contacts receive the SMS with your live location.

### Example: Simplified `App.js` Structure

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

import LoginScreen from './screens/LoginScreen';
import RegisterScreen from './screens/RegisterScreen';
import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';
import ProfileScreen from './screens/ProfileScreen';
import ContactsScreen from './screens/ContactsScreen';

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Login">
        <Stack.Screen name="Login" component={LoginScreen} options={{ headerShown: false }} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Register" component={RegisterScreen} options={{ headerShown: false }} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} options={{ title: 'ResQ' }} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} options={{ title: 'My Profile' }} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Contacts" component={ContactsScreen} options={{ title: 'Emergency Contacts' }} />
        {/* Add more screens as needed */}
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```
